# Welcome to Exploring Japan’s Restaurants ⚡️ 


## Overview

Japanese food was always one of my favorite aspects of Japan while I was living there. My friends will always ask me about food and restaurant recommendations for Japan. It could be difficult to find a good restaurant in Japan as a visitor because most reviews and articles are written in Japanese.

With this project, I’d like to provide useful information about Japanese food culture and where to find the best food in Japan through data visualization. The project is implemented by using python for data crawling, D3 for data visualization, and it is hosted on GitHub Pages.



#### A project provides useful information about where to find the best food in Japan through data visualization!
